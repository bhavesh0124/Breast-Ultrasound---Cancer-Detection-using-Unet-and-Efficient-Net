# Breast-Ultrasound---Cancer-Detection-using-Unet-and-Efficient-Net
This the implementation of Breast Cancer detection, which is a classification problem on kaggle, which consists of many models using tensorflow

The dataset is taken from here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset
 
 
Classification on pretrained imagenet weights was done using Inception Net and EfficientNetB7. The image segmentation was achieved using UNET
